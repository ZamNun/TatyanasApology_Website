<p><h2>The letter</h2></P>
<br>
<p>Dear my sweet and beautiful girlfriend,</P>
<br>
<p>I want to start off by saying that I am so very very very sorry for every single tear<br> I have caused you to cry 
and every single tear I have caused you to feel running down your beautiful shining face. 
<br>You are so precious and delicate that I feel like such a fool for making you cry every time I have unthinkingly hurt you<br> 
and made you feel disposable, unappreciated, unloved and down right neglected. <br>I have hurt you countless times and I am so sorry for all of it. 
I am sorry for all the times I have liked instagram photos of other girls, <br>I am so sorry for all the times I have made you feel less than beautiful 
and have not kept the standards in which I have set for myself. <br>I am sorry for every time I did not hold you while you were crying even 
if it was too much for me to handle. <br>I am so sorry for every night we have argued and every time I left to get a piece of mind. 
<br>I am so sorry for everytime I made you feel like you were beneath my friends and everytime I neglected you to go hang with my 
bros for a couple hours. <br>I am so sorry for everytime I walked away while you were expressing yourself and 
I may have gotten a little upset and walked away. <br>I am sorry for everytime you had to tell me how to fix something wrong 
in our relationship and I didn’t fix it. <br>I am so sorry for everytime I pushed you to go cold and every time you felt as 
though you needed to close yourself off because <br>I wasn't capable of processing emotions and resolving your issues and our issues. 
<br>I am so sorry for everytime I left you to handle your emotional burdens by yourself instead of staying there to fix it for you. 
<br>I am so sorry for everytime I told you I would fix something and I did not fix it when I said I was going to fix it. 
<br>I am so sorry for every time I was less than a lover and less than the man you needed me to be. 
<br>I am so sorry for everytime you were stressed out and I did nothing to relieve your stress. 
<br>I am so sorry for every time I made you feel as though I put our relationship on the back burner. 
<br>I am sorry for every time I did not want to spend time with you because I wanted to do other stuff. 
<br>I apologize that I do not live my life in a way that is convenient for you and will help you be emotionally secure in our relationship. 
<br>I would look to extend my deepest sorrow for everytime I pushed you to a point that you could not bear and it made you lash out at me in anger. 
<br>I am sorry for everytime I spoke a word that may have hurt your feelings and every idle word I spoke out of emotion that put you down. 
<br>I apologize for everytime I was not the strong man of God you wanted me to be or needed me to be and it put you in a terrible head space. 
<br>I am so sorry for everytime I made you feel and think as though I was cheating on you.
</P>

<p><br>I am sorry for not reassuring you of where you stand in my life and not providing you the comfort you needed to know 
that I would not cheat on you <br>and that I value our relationship too much to allow myself to fall to that level of sin. 
<br>The lord tells us that husbands are supposed to love our spouses and I am sorry if you have not felt the love, <br>affection, 
and attention that you desperately need from me. <br>I work long hours and I can not always be there when you need me to be and 
it's hard for me to balance work, <br>helping my family, and balancing my free time but I promise I am trying my hardest. 
Sometimes life gets the best of me and I do not feel like talking but <br>I promise I am just tired and only want to sleep; 
I am not cheating on you nor will I ever cheat on you. <br>I also want to apologize if 
I have done anything that reminds you of past relationships where your partner has cheated <br>or abused you heavily and 
I am sorry that I have done anything to make you feel the way those men did or even make you the slightest suspicious about that. 
<br>I am sorry for any narcissistic behavior I may exempt and all the issues I have caused you to experience ever since you met me two years ago. 
<br>I am sorry for always being drained and too tired mentally to adhere to your needs and wants when you want me too. 
<br>I am sorry for every joke I have made that made you feel as though you needed to change how you look. 
<br>I am sorry for allowing our disagreements to drag out days and days instead of doing what needs 
to be done to solve it in the moment it happens. <br>I am sorry for always wanting to leave and go be alone so 
I can think which takes time away from us. <br>I am sorry everytime I made it seem like we were breaking up and if 
I made you believe we were breaking up. <br>I am sorry for every time how I acted made you want to hurt yourself or end your life, 
<br>I should have never pushed you to that point no matter how angry or fed up I was.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I am sorry that 
I may have pushed you to be angry with me and made it feel as though you had no one to talk to a lot of 
times <br>and that you were all in this thing alone. I am sorry that I made you feel that way that was not 
conducive to your mental health <br>and that was not appealing to you or the Lord or whoever else may know. 
<br>I am sorry for all the times I did not create a safe space for you to express your emotions with me <br>and for 
you to be able to have the conversations you needed to have with me due to how you thought I may act. 
<br>I am sorry for every picture of another woman I may have liked on instagram and 
<br>I am sorry for having so many female friends and associates that it makes you uncomfortable. 
<br>I am sorry for making it seem as though I am more happy without you then I am with you. 
<br>I am sorry if I made it seem like I had more fun with other people than I did with you. 
<br>I am sorry for all the times I made it seem like our relationship was in jeopardy because of 
another woman I was not interested in. <br>I am sorry for all the times I left you by yourself because 
I needed to clear my head instead of working through the problems with you. <br>I am sorry for every 
time you missed an assignment because you were so caught up in what I was doing and what I had going on. 
<br>I am sorry for every argument I unintentionally started due to my lack of situational awareness. 
<br>I am sorry for everytime I made it seem like you were not a priority and we are not as important as you are. 
<br>I am sorry I did not spend every waking hour with you and I am sorry I did not give you all of my attention when you wanted. 
<br>I am sorry for every time I zoned out during your venting sessions. I am sorry for everytime 
<br>I did not have anything to say when you wanted me to have something to say but I was too tired to say anything at the moment 
or <br>couldn’t think of anything to say at the moment. <br> am sorry for every time I made your precious heart break because of how I was acting. 
<br>I am sorry every night I did not want to spend with you because I wanted some space for the evening. 
<br>I am sorry I made you feel as though everyone around me had an issue with you and I am sorry for all the times 
I sought outside advice about <br>our relationship and did not come to you. I am sorry that my friends got too involved 
in our relationship and it became difficult at one time. <br>I am sorry about Dallis and how insecure that situation 
made you feel and how poorly I handled it at first. <br>I am sorry about the pornography that was in my phone and that 
made you feel as well and about how I reacted and carried myself in that situation. <br>I am sorry that 
I ever made you feel as though you had to check my location all the time <br>and that you had to go through my phone all the time because 
I wasn't providing the reassurance that you needed at that time and place. <br>I am sorry that I am not always the perfect man for you 
and that I make mistakes but I am only human. <br>I am sorry for everytime I did not keep my word and I apologize for every time 
I stumbled over my own character. <br>And finally, I apologize for every time I did not want to talk about our issues <br>and fix them 
as partners because I was tired of always talking about the small problems that I ignored the bigger problems and had 
no motivation to resolve them. <br>I will see to it that moving forward I do what is necessary to uphold the sanctity of 
our relationship <br>and make sure we have what we need to be as successful as possible now, and going forward into the future. 
<br>
<br>
<p>Sincerely and with love, 
Your loving boyfriend Zamir Nunley</P>
