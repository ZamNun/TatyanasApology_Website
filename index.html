<p><h1>Introduction</h1></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><h2>My Apology</h2></p>
<p>to: Tatyana</p>
<p>from: Zamir</p>
<p>This letter that I am writing is to be made out to the very lovely woman I have chosen to have in my life and that I prayed for. 
I loved you ever since <br> I kissed you back in CD Morris’s office at Beckwith hall. 
In those days I was a wide innocent new to love. <br>I never knew the journey me and you would take together. 
I never knew me and you would have the emotional bond with me and you would experience. 
<br>I love you so very much and I am sorry for all the pain I have put you through and hopefully this letter would make it all better. 
I do not know if you will be accepting of this letter, <br>this gesture or of anything I will do to make the situation better. 
I only hope you express my apology and maybe this will show you where I am at emotionally, spiritually, <br>and where I am going in the future. 
I am only human and I am bound to mess up but that doesn’t mean I am too proud to apologize and make it up. <br>And that is what I intend to do 
and will do going forward. Love is patient, love is kind and I seek to show you that with this letter. 
<br>I poured my heart and soul into this letter and all I am asking you to do is to read it. 
I developed it into a website so that you are able to look at it on your phone <br>without much strain on
your devices and to show how much effort I am willing to put into our relationship by creating this website.
</P>
